                Putting the purpose and the why for making this article.
                The whole point of this is to illustrate some points and thoughts
                that I have learned and across and documnet a ton of my break-throughs
                that I feel like are worth sharing and I don't get too embrassed when 
                I show family and friends about this.

            <p>
                For a system like this to exist and function, there can not be elements of fantasy that should be introduced.
            </p>
            <p>
                This exists in a real-world and follows the laws of reality as one-to-one without ever breaking any fundamental rules of physics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The key difference is the characters that exist in this world intentionally push the boundaries of what is real and what is possible
            </p>
            <p>
                The best example of this is Baki. A show about a son who's trying to defeat the world's strongest man, which happns to be his father.
                His father isn't any ordinary strong fighter either, he intentionally goes out of his ways to bully other fighters that even think they 
                have a remote chance of fighting him as he sees fit, continuously fight many people at their strongest points just to 
                prove how obselete their power is to him. Lastly, puts himself in very precarious situations that most men would never 
                dare of trying even amongst the elite (i.e. Continuously fighting alpha males in the animal kingdom)
            </p>
            <p>
                Baki on the other hand, needs to congure up certain levels of disbelief or hell even delusions and even mental blocks like
                lifting 1000 kgs when reality he's benching 225 lbs. He has imaginary fights with insects, dinosaurs, and even past fighters to 
                push the limits of what is theortically possible.
