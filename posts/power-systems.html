                Putting the purpose and the why for making this article.
                The whole point of this is to illustrate some points and thoughts
                that I have learned and across and documnet a ton of my break-throughs
                that I feel like are worth sharing and I don't get too embrassed when 
                I show family and friends about this.

                    Everyone can point and tell you "Look, that's fantasy" and it makes intuitive sense.
                    However, I feel the need to clarify what makes fantasy "Fantasy" because I can't do 
                    the same with just words and images and expect people to get it. Any reference 
                    I make will literally get outdated in a year, so here are the common parameters I found;  
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Supernatural Elements/Powers</li>
                    <li>Strange Settings</li>
                    <li>Unusual Characters</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="text-center">
                    All the elements fantasy, do NOT strictly follow the rules of reality as a one-to-one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In fact, it's far more entertaining and easier to accept some of the rules being broken
                    or outright never being addressed entirely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two examples I would like to address are Mickey Mouse and Avatar: The Last Airbender

                <p>
                    A major problem that crops up is the need for

                <ol>
                    <li>Power Creep</li>
                    <li>Constant Addition of new Magic with no proper resolution</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="m-2">

                <p>
                    For a system like this to exist and function, there can not be elements of fantasy that should be introduced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This exists in a real-world and follows the laws of reality as one-to-one without ever breaking any fundamental rules of physics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The key difference is the characters that exist in this world intentionally push the boundaries of what is real and what is possible
                </p>
                <p>
                    The best example of this is Baki. A show about a son who's trying to defeat the world's strongest man, which happns to be his father.
                    His father isn't any ordinary strong fighter either, he intentionally goes out of his ways to bully other fighters that even think they 
                    have a remote chance of fighting him as he sees fit, continuously fight many people at their strongest points just to 
                    prove how obselete their power is to him. Lastly, puts himself in very precarious situations that most men would never 
                    dare of trying even amongst the elite (i.e. Continuously fighting alpha males in the animal kingdom)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Baki on the other hand, needs to congure up certain levels of disbelief or hell even delusions and even mental blocks like
                    lifting 1000 kgs when reality he's benching 225 lbs. He has imaginary fights with insects, dinosaurs, and even past fighters to 
                    push the limits of what is theortically possible.
