                A question as old as time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some aim to answer the concept of "evil" as the lack of good.
                What the fuck does that even mean? Lack of good? How do I
                write a lack of good? That's basically every character that
                I've read or written about.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">
                Including God. God is evil.
            </p>
            <p>
                While an 'evil' god theory and hell even would be an interesting premise
                it's important to understand what 'evil' even is and how to write the
                idea down correctly in our fiction. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to make it very clear I simply can not cover all the ascepts of
                what 'evil' is meant to be but I can assure it is not a made-up word.
                That's a lie. It's a word that been around for a while to summarize
                and even act as an umbrella term to describe and understand that bad things that
                happen to us and others around (the including the dead).
            </p>
            <p>
                Google cheaps out claiming evil is the opposite of good and it's
                'morally wrong'. Like we, as humans, get it but try explaining that
                to someone who's lived under a rock or aliens. Their follow-up 
                questions will be "what's good / morality?", which is
                the same thing and why should we care. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To answer both, we have to define, what we currently understand as 
                good and morality, and why it not only helps in our survival but 
                in our soul-like fulfillment. Like it or not, a lot of religious
                texts do answer the question and sometimes do an extremely well
                job at not only identifying it but also teach us how to identify it.

            <p>
                Many ancient stories do not display as this overwhelming and powerful
                foe that gets his way with force. However, it is a strong threat that
                has claimed many lives over the centuries and god has either had to
                slay these creatures on our behalf or we need his help to deal with 
                these forces.
            </p>
            <p>
                What confuses people about 'evil' is that people can do 'immoral things'
                like petty theft or robbery or murder but still be considered likeable 
                and even a friend. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's not forget about the crusades and millions of people that were slaugherted 
                that didn't say the right thing or 'bow' to something that they couldn't
                understand.

            <h3 id="title1">Evil as Humans</h3>
            <p>
                Truth is, to know if 
                someone has committed an act of evil. 

                You must watch their words, and most importantly their actions.
                
                Evil will lie, to no end. They will lie
                to their parents, to their friends, to their
                children, to their people, to their leaders, 
                and worst of all, they will lie to themselves.

                That's why it's so goddamn believable. They're 
                always being watched so it's important to play the 
                part at all times. That's why when they believe they
                have some privacy, where no one (important) notices
                who they are. They exhale and finally let loose all
                the noises and intentions they wish to spread to
                others but can't just yet. Not until they have achieved
                or very close to achieving their goals.
                
                The false confidence comes from their self-identification
                from deep within, that's who they are truly are, not whatever
                they use to be before.

                Words can and will fool, everyone. Because when meeting someone
                new, that's all we have to go on. They ultimate deciding factor
                of someone's evil intent, comes down to their actions and their
                following reaction.
                
                They 
                will see how far they can go with their deed and their actions
                make no sense until you realize that everything they do is to
                keep the lie going for as long as they possible can, wihtout
                having to share any of the profits / goods with others.

                It's a number's game. You only ever hear about the successful
                ones. Sometimes they are more glorified and celebrated than
                the deeds and kindly left by (past and modern) heroes.
            </p>
            <p>
                This kind of evil hurts everyone, I mean everyone involved
                if it is NOT 1. Identified, 2. Social
