                Although, you don't want to write only smart characters in your story. You (the author), at least,
                want to be able to demonstrate your characters are capable of intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's a whole field of evoluotionary psychology that wishes to discuss
                how intelligence was developed from babies to adults and evolved into problem-solving and
                incredible memorization but that's outside the scope of this blog.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also making the assumption here that if a shrad of glass is picked and held tightly,
                with the sharpest and mostly pointy edge is held like s knife. It's safe to assume that 
                piece of glass will be used as a weapon.
            </p>

                Subversions are only effective, when the audience is distracted from the main purpose / use of the 
                object.
            </p>
            <p>
                My main purpose is to describe a few interesting traits that I've discovered in other 
                stories that have intelligence and have proven it to the audience in real-time.

                There are two ways this can be done. 1. The character has the
                freedom to explore who they are and what they can do. 2. The
                character is restricted by rules from doing whatever they want.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's also the mindset needed for them to be intelligent thinkers
                or for it have the opposite effect. 
            </p>
            <div class="p-4">
                <p>
                    1. The character must play by the rules effectively
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. The character mut find the truth hidden within the truth.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                The character(s) like the audience first learn of the rules of 
                the games and then actively test and see what they can get away 
                with and what rules are enforced rigorously and what is 
                intentionally left out.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rules exist to prevent the intelligent character from doing
                directly what they want so they have to work around the rules to 
                get what they want, through any means necessary (this is where the
                character trait comes into play.)
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">
                The important part is here, is the discovery.

                All that trail and error from earlier is put into play. Everything 
                that the audience and characters have learned are coming full circle.
            </p>
            <p>
                What makes this unique from <a href="#exploiting-loopholes">Exploiting Loopholes</a>
                is either
                repeatability and/or the relevatation of the loophole.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this is point, it's up to you (the author/writer) to determine whether
                the intelligent character should give a play-by-play of his plan either
                out loud or in his head or have the action/plan play out (and leave the
                audience to fill in the blanks).

                This is also the perfect time to introduce small tactics and gambits that
                paid-off or have been set-up in the past to be used as part of the master
                plan to achieve to make progress or to take specific actions they couldn't
                make otherwise.

                    There can only be one. The top dog. The King. Whatever you (the author) wish to call this position,

            <p>
                Most of you think problem-solving, memorization of key facts, noticing
                important details, at the right placetime is a given but there's so much
                to unpack here.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">
                Intelligence is never only just logical.
            </p>
            <p>
                These aren't elements but tools for great intelligence and it doesn't always
                have to be the logical kind. There are many kinds of intelligence that often
                get overlooked:

                Hot Take: Characters are only as smart as the authors that write them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the perfect excuse to research your topic and know it well.
                I'm calling you a baby (if you don't know the subject you're talking
                about that well).
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">
                Always do your Research.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cite it in your notes and your drafts if you have to. The last thing
                you want to do is to have the concieted idea that you know better than
                your audience (whom you can safely assume will attempt to fact check you).
            </p>
            <p>
                Your audience (especially the smart ones) will greatly appreciate when you
                (the author) research your topic, cite your sources, and beautifully craft
                in your ways about a topic that deserve the respect that your audience gives
                to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's no excuse for not doing this.
                A big exmaple of this terrible planning in a plot and it feels disingioues
                to both the audience (excited to learn and enjoy while doing so) 
                and the author that wrote it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Audiences ALWAYS crave for good well-written out stories and there aren't
                enough of them out there.
            </p>
            <p>
                You (the author) are letting yourself down by not improving or even using this
                chance to learn. Even if the story doesn't hit the shelves, you have learned 
                something new and have a new found apprication for it and it will become a book
                of knowledge that you can reference when you want to write a new story with a 
                similar subject matter.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the one profession that allows you to pour everything including your 
                intelligence into a craft.
